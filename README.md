This is the dissertation project for CASA Connected Environment. 

## Overview
This project uses a low-cost infrared imaging camera **FLIR Lepton**. It deploys the lightweight neural network, **MobileNet** to a tiny single-board computer **Raspberry Pi**. The dataset and model was trained on Edge Inpulse, (link). By evaluating different model experiments, this project achieved an accuracy of 96.2%, and can successfully distinguish up to 7 people.
